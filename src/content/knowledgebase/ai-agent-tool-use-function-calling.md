# What is AI Agent Tool Use (Function Calling)?

## Introduction to Tool Use

If you type a question into a standard Large Language Model interface (like ChatGPT in 2022), it is entirely confined to a text-in, text-out paradigm. 
If you ask the model, *"What is the weather in Orlando today?"*, it will apologize and explain that it does not have access to live internet data. If you ask it to *"Send an email to my boss,"* it cannot. The AI is a brilliant brain trapped in a jar, completely severed from the outside world.

**Tool Use** (formally known as **Function Calling** in the OpenAI API) is the architectural breakthrough that breaks the glass. It is the mechanism that allows an LLM to interface with the physical world, connect to databases, and execute live code. It is the core defining feature that turns a static Chatbot into an autonomous **AI Agent**.

## How Function Calling Works

Function Calling does not mean the AI actually runs code. An LLM is just a text generator. It cannot execute a Python script. Function Calling is an orchestrated dance between the LLM and the software application hosting it.

Here is the exact step-by-step architecture:

### 1. The Developer Defines the Tools
The software engineer writes a standard Python function to check the weather. They then send the OpenAI API a JSON schema describing this tool.
*   *Hey GPT-4, you have a tool called `get_weather`. It requires one parameter: a `city` (string).*

### 2. The Model Generates a "Call"
The user prompts the chatbot: *"Is it raining in Orlando?"*
The LLM processes this. It realizes its internal knowledge is insufficient. Instead of replying to the user with English text, the LLM outputs a highly structured JSON object requesting the tool.
*   *LLM Output:* `{"name": "get_weather", "arguments": {"city": "Orlando"}}`

### 3. The Application Executes the Code
The software application intercepts this JSON object before it reaches the user. The application physically executes the `get_weather("Orlando")` Python function, hits a live weather API, and gets the result: *"75 degrees and Sunny."*

### 4. The Loop Closes
The application takes the result ("75 degrees and Sunny") and instantly fires a *second* prompt back to the LLM behind the scenes: *"The tool returned: 75 and sunny."*
The LLM reads this new context and finally generates the English response to the user: *"No, it is currently 75 degrees and sunny in Orlando."*

## The Impact on Enterprise Architecture

Tool Use radically transforms how enterprises build software. Instead of building massive, complex graphical user interfaces (GUIs) with hundreds of buttons, developers can expose their internal APIs directly to an LLM.

*   **[Data Lakehouse](https://iceberglakehouse.com/iceberg/data-lakehouse/) Queries**: An agent can be given a `run_sql` tool. When the CEO asks for a revenue report, the Agent automatically writes the SQL, uses the tool to query the [Dremio](https://opendatalakehouse.com/kb/dremio/) Lakehouse, and returns the chart.
*   **Customer Support**: An agent can be given a `refund_order` tool. It can authenticate the user, verify the shipping delay, and physically execute the Stripe API call to refund the customer's credit card without any human intervention.

## The Security Risks

Giving an AI the ability to execute physical actions introduces terrifying security risks (often called **Confused Deputy Attacks** or **Prompt Injection**). 
If an Agent has a `delete_database_table` tool, a malicious user could write a clever prompt that tricks the LLM into deciding it is a good idea to drop the entire production database. 

To mitigate this, enterprise architectures mandate "Human-in-the-Loop" validation for destructive tools. The LLM can generate the JSON request to execute a refund, but the application pauses and forces a human manager to click "Approve" before the code physically runs.

## Conclusion

Tool Use is the catalyst for the [Agentic AI](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/agentic-ai/) era. By standardizing the format by which neural networks request external API execution (Function Calling), companies like OpenAI and Anthropic transformed LLMs from static encyclopedias into dynamic digital workers, capable of navigating the internet, manipulating enterprise software, and autonomously executing complex business workflows.
