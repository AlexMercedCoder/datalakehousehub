# What is Data Product Manager?

## Introduction to the Data Product Manager

In traditional software engineering, the role of the **Product Manager (PM)** has been established for decades. If a company is building a new mobile app, the Software Engineers write the code, but the Product Manager decides *what* the app should do. The PM interviews customers, researches the market, defines the feature requirements, and ensures the final app actually solves a human problem.

Historically, the Data Engineering world did not have Product Managers. 
Data Engineers operated as an internal "Service Desk." A business executive would submit a Jira ticket saying, *"I need a dashboard showing sales by region."* The data engineer would blindly write the SQL, build the dashboard, and close the ticket. A month later, the engineer would discover that the executive never actually looked at the dashboard because it was too confusing. Millions of dollars of engineering time were wasted building things nobody wanted.

To solve this, the industry created the **Data Product Manager (DPM)**. This role treats data not as a background IT service, but as a formal, tangible "Product" that must be managed, marketed, and continuously improved.

## The Philosophy of "Data as a Product"

The DPM operates on the core principle of **Data as a Product** (a foundational concept of the [Data Mesh](https://iceberglakehouse.com/iceberg/iceberg-data-mesh/) architecture). 

A "Data Product" is not necessarily a piece of software sold to external customers. It is any curated, high-quality data asset that is actively consumed by users. 
Examples of internal Data Products include:
*   A clean, perfectly maintained `360_Customer_Profile` table in the [Data Lakehouse](https://iceberglakehouse.com/iceberg/data-lakehouse/).
*   A highly accurate Machine Learning model predicting inventory shortages.
*   A real-time executive dashboard tracking supply chain metrics.

## The Responsibilities of a Data Product Manager

The DPM sits directly between the Business Stakeholders (who need insights) and the Data Engineers (who build the pipelines).

### 1. Discovering the True Need
If an executive asks for a "Machine Learning AI to predict sales," a bad data engineer will immediately start writing Python code. 
A good Data Product Manager will stop and ask *"Why?"* 
Through user interviews, the DPM might discover the executive doesn't actually need AI; they just need an automated daily email showing the previous day's sales numbers. The DPM saves the engineering team six months of wasted AI development by identifying the true, underlying business need.

### 2. Defining the SLA (Service Level Agreement)
The DPM treats the data table exactly like a SaaS software product. They define strict guarantees for the users:
*   **Freshness**: The data will be updated every day by 8:00 AM.
*   **Quality**: The data will never have more than 0.1% null values.
If the engineering pipeline breaks and misses the SLA, it is treated as a severe "Product Outage," exactly as if the company's main website had crashed.

### 3. Measuring Adoption and ROI
A traditional data team measures success by asking: *"Did the SQL query finish running?"*
A Data Product Manager measures success by asking: *"Are people actually using this?"* 
The DPM tracks the telemetry of the dashboard. If they notice the Marketing team hasn't logged into the new analytics platform in three weeks, the DPM proactively interviews the Marketing team to figure out why the "Product" is failing, and works with the engineers to redesign the user experience.

## The Skillset

A Data Product Manager requires a highly specific, rare combination of skills. They must be technically literate enough to understand the difference between a Kafka stream and a batch ETL job, so they don't promise the business impossible features. Simultaneously, they must possess extreme emotional intelligence and business acumen to navigate corporate politics, interview executives, and align the data roadmap with the company's financial goals.

## Conclusion

The rise of the Data Product Manager represents the end of the "ticket-taker" era for data teams. By adopting the rigorous, user-centric methodologies of traditional software product management, DPMs ensure that highly expensive Data Engineering and AI resources are laser-focused on building pristine, reliable data assets that genuinely solve critical business problems and drive measurable ROI.
