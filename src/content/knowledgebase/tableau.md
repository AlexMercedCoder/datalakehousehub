# What is Tableau?

## Introduction to Tableau

Before the 2010s, Business Intelligence was a bleak landscape. Generating a report required an analyst to write complex code, wait for IT to process an OLAP cube, and output a static, boring bar chart. 

Founded in 2003 as a research project at Stanford University, **Tableau** revolutionized the industry by introducing the concept of **Visual Analytics**. 

Tableau operates on a fundamentally different philosophy than its predecessors: humans are highly visual creatures. Instead of forcing analysts to think in rows and columns, Tableau allows users to explore data intuitively. You drag a pill labeled "Sales" onto a canvas, and the software instantly renders a visual representation of the mathematics. It single-handedly created the "Self-Service BI" era.

## The Architecture of Tableau

Tableau's power comes from a proprietary technology called **VizQL (Visual Query Language)**.

When a user drags a field (like "Region") onto the Tableau canvas, VizQL instantly translates that physical mouse movement into an optimized database query (like SQL), executes the query against the database, and then translates the numerical result into a visual chart (like a Map). 
This allows users with zero coding experience to execute highly complex, multi-dimensional database aggregations simply by clicking and dragging.

### Connection Types: Live vs. Extracts

Tableau provides two distinct ways to interact with data.

1.  **Tableau Extracts (.hyper)**: If the underlying database is incredibly slow (e.g., an unoptimized on-premises Oracle server), Tableau can execute a massive query overnight, extract the data, and store it in Tableau's proprietary, in-memory, highly compressed format called the Hyper engine. 
    *   *Pros*: The dashboard loads instantly because the data is stored in RAM inside Tableau Server.
    *   *Cons*: The data is stale. You are looking at yesterday's data. It creates a Data Silo.
2.  **Live Connections**: Tableau connects directly to the database. When the user clicks a filter, Tableau pushes the SQL query down to the database and waits for the answer.
    *   *Pros*: The data is 100% real-time and perfectly accurate. 
    *   *Cons*: If the database is slow, the Tableau dashboard will be slow, causing a terrible user experience.

## Tableau and the Modern Data Stack

The industry's shift toward the **[Data Lakehouse](https://iceberglakehouse.com/iceberg/data-lakehouse/)** has radically changed how Tableau is used.

Historically, organizations relied heavily on Tableau Extracts because their databases were too slow. Today, organizations have high-speed cloud data warehouses (like Snowflake) and federated Lakehouse engines (like [Dremio](https://opendatalakehouse.com/kb/dremio/)). 

Because engines like [Dremio](https://opendatalakehouse.com/kb/dremio/) use sub-second caching (Data Reflections), organizations are abandoning Tableau Extracts. They configure Tableau to use strict **Live Connections** directly to the [Semantic Layer](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/semantic-layer/). 
This is the ultimate architectural pattern: Tableau acts purely as the "dumb glass" visualization layer, while the Lakehouse engine handles all the complex logic, security masking, and caching. This guarantees that the dashboards are both instantly fast and mathematically synchronized across the entire company.

## Conclusion

Acquired by Salesforce in 2019 for $15.7 billion, Tableau remains one of the most powerful and widely beloved Business Intelligence platforms in the world. By abstracting away the complexity of database querying and replacing it with an intuitive, drag-and-drop visual interface, Tableau empowered an entire generation of non-technical business users to become analytical powerhouses, fundamentally changing how organizations interact with their data.
