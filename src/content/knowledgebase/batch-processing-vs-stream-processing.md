# What is Batch Processing vs Stream Processing?

## Introduction to Data Processing Models

At its core, Data Engineering is the practice of moving data from Point A (a source database) to Point B (an analytical dashboard) and transforming it along the way. Historically, there are two distinct mathematical and architectural models for executing this movement: **Batch Processing** and **Stream Processing**.

The choice between these two paradigms dictates the latency of your data (how old the data is when the CEO looks at it), the cost of your cloud infrastructure, and the complexity of your engineering pipelines.

## Batch Processing: Massive and Scheduled

**Batch Processing** is the traditional method of handling data. In this model, data is collected, stored, and processed in large chunks (batches) on a rigid, predetermined schedule.

### How it Works
Imagine an e-commerce website. Throughout the day, every user purchase is logged into a raw PostgreSQL database. The data is completely ignored by the analytics team all day.
At exactly 2:00 AM, a massive [Apache Spark](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/apache-spark/) cluster wakes up. It pulls the entire day's worth of transactions (e.g., 5 million rows), cleans them, aggregates the total revenue, writes the final numbers to an [Apache Iceberg](https://iceberglakehouse.com/iceberg/iceberg-catalog/) table, and then shuts down at 3:00 AM. 

*   **Pros**: Highly efficient and cost-effective. Because you only turn the massive compute cluster on for 1 hour a day, you save massive amounts of money. It handles complex, massive table joins across petabytes of historical data flawlessly.
*   **Cons**: **Latency**. If the CEO checks the dashboard at 4:00 PM, they are looking at data that is up to 24 hours old. It is useless for real-time operational decisions.

## Stream Processing: Continuous and Immediate

**Stream Processing** is the modern method of handling data, treating data not as static tables, but as a continuous, never-ending river of events.

### How it Works
Instead of waiting for 2:00 AM, the e-commerce website pushes every single purchase instantly into a message broker like **[Apache Kafka](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/apache-kafka/)**. 
A stream processing engine (like **[Apache Flink](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/apache-flink/)**) runs 24/7. The exact millisecond a user buys a product, Flink intercepts the event, adds it to a running total in memory, and updates the database instantly. 

*   **Pros**: **Sub-second Latency**. The dashboard is always a mathematically perfect representation of the exact current state of the business. It enables autonomous systems (like fraud detection and algorithmic trading) that require instant reflexes.
*   **Cons**: Extremely expensive and complex. The compute cluster must run 24/7/365. Handling delayed data, network outages, and stateful memory management (e.g., "windowing" calculations over a 5-minute period) requires specialized, highly complex engineering.

## The Convergence: The Unified Model

Historically, organizations had to build two completely separate pipelines (The [Lambda Architecture](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/lambda-architecture/)): a Batch pipeline for deep historical analytics, and a Streaming pipeline for real-time alerts.

Modern architectures (The [Kappa Architecture](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/kappa-architecture/)) and modern frameworks are converging. 
*   **[Apache Flink](https://datalakehousehub.com/knowledgebase/apache-flink/)** allows engineers to write one set of code that treats batch data simply as a "stream that eventually stops." 
*   **Micro-batching** (used by Spark Structured Streaming) blurs the lines by running batch jobs every 30 seconds.

Ultimately, the choice depends on the business requirement. If you are calculating the quarterly tax report, use Batch. If you are predicting if an Uber driver will arrive in 3 minutes, use Streaming.
